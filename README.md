# Blind Auction Game

🎯 **Overview**  
A Python project that simulates a blind auction where users submit bids for an item. The program collects the bids, compares them, and announces the highest bidder as the winner.

---

## 🛠 **How It Works**

1. Users are prompted to enter their names and bids.
2. After each bid, the program asks if there are more bidders.
3. The program stores each user's bid and compares them to determine the highest bid.
4. Once bidding ends, the program announces the highest bidder and their bid.
